          2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018,

           the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game.

                2018 respectively. Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the
                 Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year. 
                 Additionally, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive
                  years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna
